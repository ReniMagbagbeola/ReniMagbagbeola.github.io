# About me

Most of my research has focused on proprioception and using robotics (specifically robotics control) to provide intelligent and autonomous feedback to users. This culminated in my PhD in Adaptive Sensory Robotics where I explored using artifical intelligence to autonomously control vibrational feedback to prosthesis users. This allows for consistent perception of feedback for the user resulting in reduced neuropathic pain. 

Prior to the PhD I obtained a BSEE degree in Electrical Engineering (with a focus on Robotic Control) and a BSc in Applied Physics from the University of Washington. As such I have extensive experience with hardware design and embedded engineering. After my bachelors I returned to the UK and completed an Msc degree in Robotics and Computation and University College London. 

## Robotics expertise

I have experience in the following areas:

* Experience with Robot Operating System (ROS) and ROS2
* Programming expereince in Python (5+ years), Matlab/Simulink (5+ years), C (5 years), and C++ (3 years) 
* Implementation of existing solution on custom robot platforms (such as robot_hardware_interface, move_base and ros_control)
* Serial Communication protocols UART, I2C, SPi, Ethernet/IP, CAN, RS-232 AND RS-485
* Hardware: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BeagleBone, Nvidia Jetson, ESP 432
* Hardware and sensor integration on custom robot platforms
* Experience with Docker, Git, and Linux

## Other Experience
* Experience with CAD and 3D Printing
* Experience with Machine Learning (Supervised and Reinforcement)
* Experience with common AI frameworks such as PyTorch, Open AI Gym and Tensorflow
* Experience applying custom AI algorithms to robotic applications 
* Robotic Kinematics
* Some experience with SLAM

## Teaching Experience
* Maths Tutor at Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment (CLUE) @University of Washington. Specialising in teaching linear algebra to upwards of 60 students
* Post graduate teaching assistant for Robotic Control Theory and Systems, Robotics Programming and Engineering Challenges at University College London
* Mathematics and computer science tutor for Oppidan Education
* Private maths, physics and computer science tuition.
