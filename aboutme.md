# About me

I've enjoyed the robotics world since I was twelve years old. I've explored everything from Brain-Computer interfacing to remotely monitoring gaseos volcanoes in St Lucia. I've spent a lot of time within academic settings and most of my research interests has focused on proprioception and using robotics (specifically robotics control and embedded systems) to provide intelligent and autonomous feedback. The variability that biology gives when dealing with robotics makes for interesting control problems. This culminated in my PhD in Adaptive Sensory Robotics where I explored using artifical intelligence to autonomously control vibrational feedback to prosthesis users. This allows for consistent perception of feedback for the user resulting in reduced neuropathic pain. 

More recently I took the step outside of the university and started applying my love of robots to industry. I wanted a change and a chance to see robots in the environment in which they are built for and so found myself as a robotics engineer within the oil and gas industry. This has been a rewarding and interesting experience and so far has taught me that we still have a long way to go before robots are used routinely and reliably. 

Outside of robots I'm a bit of a theatre nerd and find myself on the west end whenever time (and funds) allow. I've dabbled in theatre reviewing and more recently got back in touch with my artistic side ([Surge III](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/postgraduate-study/postgraduate-community/stories/surge-iii-layers-of-perception-by-natalia-mesa)). 

Prior to the PhD I obtained a BSEE degree in Electrical Engineering (with a focus on Robotic Control) and a BSc in Applied Physics from the University of Washington (2:1 equivalent). As such I have extensive experience with hardware design and embedded engineering. After my bachelors I returned to the UK and completed an Msc degree in Robotics and Computation @UCL (Distinction).
