Currently working as a Robotics engineer in the oil and gas industry. My primary role is to develop and deploy robots in a range of environments. I work extremely closely with well known industrial robotics companies. 

This work is ongoing and so I cannot go into detail via the website. If you would like to know more please contact me directly.
