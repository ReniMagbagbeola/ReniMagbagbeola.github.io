I have had the good fortune of being part of some outreach programs @UCL, one of which was the bioinspired robotics summer school. This program was run between UCL and IN2ScienceUK.

The project aims to allow students (year 12) and teachers to explore links between biology and robotics in an affordable and accessible way. They were tasked with using the microbit, servo motors, motor drivers and laser cut pieces to build a "fish", "caterpillar", and "cockroach".

In 2018 and 2019 I was a teaching assistant for the project and spent a week with the students helping them build small robots from a kit UCL provides. Outside of this I was responsible for a time of maintaining the equipment and designing new components. I also took the opportunity to make some fun adjustments to the robots with the students during the outreach week.
