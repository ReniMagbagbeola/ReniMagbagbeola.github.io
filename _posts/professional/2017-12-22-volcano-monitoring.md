Following my Msc I had the opportunity to be part of a interdisiplinary team @UCL, the University of the West Indies and Montserrat Volcano Observatory. The aim of the project was to remotely monitor gaseous activity on volcanos to help mitigate community concerns of volcanic emissions. I was bought on as a design and systems engineer and tasked with designing and building a low-cost system to monitor CO2 emissions remotely.

The work was conducted at Sulpher Springs in St Lucia and the device placed on an area of low human traffic with large amounts of gaseous activity.

I used an LoPy board, IoT platform based on MicroPython board, to communicate with the rest of the sensing equipment and streamed the data to an isolated network at a nearby waystation. This was then streamed to a website that could be access remotely from anywhere in the world.

This was a fun project and elements of the work continues to be used by the seismic research centre in St Lucia. This work was presented at the EGU General Assembly 2018 and was part of research conducted by Lara Smale, Stephen Hailes, Christopher Kilburn, Erouscilla Joseph, and Carlisle Williams.
