Currently working as a post graduate researcher in surgical robotics at the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS). During my time at WEISS I have been responsible for the hardware and software design of a robotic organ perfusion machine designed to keep organs alive ex-vivo for an extended period of time. This research is an interdisiplinary effort between 4 departments at UCL and the Royal Free Hospital. Work is still underway and papers are currently pending.

Entire system is run from a raspberry pi and various communication protocopls such as MODBUS, UART, RS232 AND RS485 are used to interface with oxygen, temperature, pressure, flow, and pH sensors. Current work revolves around creating an autonomous system that can provide ablation therapy to a wide range of organs for treatment of tumors.

I am currently working on this project via an honorary contract from UCL. I was recently awarded an 80k grant to develop this work further and so am supervising research assistants and PhD students to continue the work moving forward. Several papers are pending publication and this remains to be a highly collaborative piece of work! Please contact me directly if you wish to know more
