A cute little project I did whilst at Mathworks was prep a simulation environment for their Mars Rover competition. The idea was to port existent controllers and behaviour state machines to work with ROS and Gazebo. This actually was my very first ROS experience. I had to build my first URDF of their mars rover bot, setup the gazebo world, make sure ros_control was functioning and communicatin with Simulink and Stateflow correctly etc. Was fun :)
