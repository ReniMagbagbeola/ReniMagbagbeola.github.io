One of the first side projects I did during my PhD was develop the hardware coursework for the Robotic Sensing, Manipulation and Interaction module  offered by UCL Masters in Robotics and Computation programme. 

The idea of the course at the time was to teach students rapid prototyping skills and get them to work with different sensors. To achieve that, we have developed  a mock  force spectroscopy setup. It was simply made out of 3 axis ganty with a force sensor and camera. The students were taught to use a raspberry py to control the axis servos, read force sensor data and setup camera stream for long experiments.

Throughout the term, students wer task to develop the software side of the setup. They were given differn samples to scan and recreate their surfaces.
