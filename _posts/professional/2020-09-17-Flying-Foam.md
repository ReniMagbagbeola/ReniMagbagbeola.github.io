Back in 2014 I did my very first internship at Mathworks. The project was an application engineering one. Under the supervision of [Owen McAree](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-mcaree/) we've constructed a custom UAV for exhibition at MATLAB Expo 2014. The project aimed to showcase that you can use matlab codegen with  hobby level targets (Raspi/arduino) to control and stabalise a UAV.

Here's how it looked at the expo:

As shouted in the video, the custom design and the teather made the quad very unstable. Hence the vision based state estimation and matlab pid controllers are actually doing an impressive job here. Here are some more tests:
