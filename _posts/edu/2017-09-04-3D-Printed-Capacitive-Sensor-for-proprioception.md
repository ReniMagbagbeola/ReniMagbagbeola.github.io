As part of my masters thesis I designed a 3D printable capacitive pressure sensor. The idea was for it to be printed with a version of the stanmore robotic arm for prosthesis users in a single print.

This project involved designing and fabircating my own custom PCB board as well as rigging a force gauge to accurately correlate pressure with change in capacitance. Using an arduino code was written to produce different colours on a LED depending on the range of pressure placed on the sensor.
