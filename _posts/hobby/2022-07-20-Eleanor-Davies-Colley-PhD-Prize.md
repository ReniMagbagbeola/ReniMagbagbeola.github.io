Each year the Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences award the Eleanor Davies-Colley PhD Prize to the top PhD candidate in the division. Applicants are shortlisted to the top 4 and are instructed to give a 3 minute summary of their thesis. I was shortlisted and presented at last years competition where I was awarded a runner up prize.
