In 2021 I took part in UCL's first Robotics [workshop](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/robotics/events/first-ucl-robotics-workshop/first-ucl-robotics-institute-workshop-posters) which saw presentations and posters from the robotics community at UCL. I was fortunate enough to present my PhD work at the workshop and won a best poster award

Following the success of the robotics workshop, UCL recently had their second robotics [workshop](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/robotics/ucl-robotics-23-revisiting-event) which was open to the general public. For this instead of being a student contributor I was part of the organising comittee. It was a great success with hundreds of people comes from academia and industry attending.
