Probably my first actual experience with Robotics when I was about 16. At the time I was interested in electronics and brain computer interfaces but didn't have the necessary resources or knowledge to get started learning any of it. I enrolled in a summer school at Harvard University and took a course in "Mobile Robotics and Embedded Programming" and "Neurobiology". 

The course was good fun as we built a maze solving robot from scratch in C. The final assessment was whether the Robot could navigate through any maze successfully. We integrated sonar, infared, and QTI sensors integrated into the robot and wrote a corresponding algorithm to navigate through an unseen maze. A PSoC board was used with a miniprog programmer/debugger as a microcontroller. I had fantastic teachers and teammates at the time who taught me the fundementals of programming, electronics and algorithms. The course counted towards university credits that could be used as part of my undergraduate degree.

The video shows our final exam assessment. Needless to say it was a close call! 

This was a team based project. The other members of the team were Brian Fischer, Ferda Taylor, Andrew Wang, and Nan Jiang
