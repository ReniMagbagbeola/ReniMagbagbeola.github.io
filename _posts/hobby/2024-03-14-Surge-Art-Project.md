SURGE III is the third instalment of UAL's Post-Grad Community (PGC) and UCL's WEISS Centre collaborative programme that brings together scientists, artists and the public to explore the complexities and application of technology in surgery.

I had a pleasure of working with [Natalia Mesa](https://www.nataliamesart.com/) on bringing my PhD work on prosthetics to life! We workshopped with individuals who had suffered from amputations and discussed how my research could impact their lives. It was overall a very rewarding 

The work is currently featured in an exhibition being displayed at the Lethaby Gallery in Central Saint Martins (1 Granary Square, Kings Cross)
