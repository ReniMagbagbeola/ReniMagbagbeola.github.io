A good friend of mine started this project by 3d printing all the necessary parts. Unfortnately, he did not have the time to complete it and very kindly let me take the parts of his hands.

Since then I've 3D printed a few more parts and finished up the electrical system. Still a work in progress but the next part involves testing out a few algorithms and alternative sensors. This is more a hobby project I work on during free time (not that I have much of that nowadays!) Hoping to get a little more done this summer (2023)
