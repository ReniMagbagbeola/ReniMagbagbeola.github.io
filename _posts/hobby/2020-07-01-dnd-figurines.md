I've always found physical labour therapeutic. Naturally, this meant that getting my first personal 3D Printer (Prusa MK3S) lead to a fury of house DIY projects. However, there are only so many  custom shelves you can make and so I turned to the time sink vortex that is dnd figurines.

Using the standard 0.4mm nozzle would ofcourse not lead to great results. However, I discovered that Prusa sells and supports 0.25mm nozzles. This meant that you could get reasonable (poor to low medium) quality for pretty much negligent costs. Overall the utility/price ratio is fantastic given that buying figurines otherwise would be crazy expensive (10s to 100s of pounds).
