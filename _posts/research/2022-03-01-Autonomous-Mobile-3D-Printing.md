The last few years of my PhD are slowly coming together. This is what it's all been about: Autonomous Mobile 3D Printing of Large-Scale Trajectories. The robot is only given the print path and it figures out the rest. These results are in review as part of a submission to IROS 2022. More on this when the paper is out.
