[Mobile Agile Printer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8593815) was my very first paper. It is a systems intergration work  that merges my own and [Daniel Butters'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbutters/) MSc projects together. The paper covers two main topics - the omni-directionality of this custom mobile base and the (lack of) deterioration of arm end-effector trajectory during base motion. The central learning here is that printing-in-motion should be feasibile as the base motion is not drastically effecting the end-effector. Here is the video acompanying the paper:

My side of this project mostly focussed on the development of the mobile base itself, wheel/leg/robot-level controllers and the overall robot behaviour. One of my favourite parts of the project were the number of cute control bits throughout the base-arm hierarchy. The legs would sometimes rotated in different directions based on the shorter angle difference or the robot velocity gain was made to be a function of the allignment of the four legs.

The AML lab, which I was part of at the time, had future plans for the MAP robot. And so, one year later another Msc student,[Pedro Javier Rodr√≠guez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-javier-rodr%C3%ADguez-26a287140/), under my supervision began works in implementing planned design improvements. These included changing to hoverboard-style hub motors, introducing a second mounding frame and shifting construction to aluminium extrusion. And another two years later a third MSc student, [Andras Nagy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andras-nagy-13473b208/), finished the work.
