To help finish off my Phd, I've decided to invest some money into my own robot. It took few weeks of planning, hours and hours of CAD modelling and a million Ebay browser tabs. I'd also like to thank [Jose Mendoza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseluisesp/), [Bart Garcia-Nathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bart-garcia-nathan-50359517a/), [Sebastian Kay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-kay/) and [George Dwyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-dwyer/) for providing feedback on my designs and help with assembly.

Fortunately, the build day went very smoothly and mobile platform was essentially completed in one day.
