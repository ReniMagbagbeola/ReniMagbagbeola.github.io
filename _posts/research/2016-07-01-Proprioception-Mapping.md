This was my first experience in a research lab. I worked in Chet Moritz lab for restorative technologies as an undergradutate researcher @University of Washington for three years. Aside from helping the other researchers with various tasks, I was also given my own project to correlate cortical activity in mice to proprioception. I used a Novint falcon haptic device integrated with chai 3D and modified it to control mice's forearm movement and monitored it using a streovision camera setup. It was hoped to then use BCI devices implaced in the mice to correlate the movement to cortical activity, however, I graduated before this part of the project was complete.
