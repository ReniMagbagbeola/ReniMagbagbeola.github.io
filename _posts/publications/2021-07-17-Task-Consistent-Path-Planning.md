It is often the case that robotics conferences view hardware papers with with more leniency. Exactly for this reason, I am extra proud of my paper on [Task-Consistent Path Planning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353924035_Task-Consistent_Path_Planning_for_Mobile_3D_Printing)as , unlike my first two papers, it had no hardware components at all. This work is entirely in constrained sampling based path planning and addresses, what I deam to be, a core problem of mobile 3D printing. That is, the ability of the robot to plan for executing print trajectories much larger than itself. Here is a video explaining the approach:
