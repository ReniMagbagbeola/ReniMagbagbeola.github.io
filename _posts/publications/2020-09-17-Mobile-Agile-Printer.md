[Mobile Agile Printer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8593815) was my very first paper. It is a systems intergration work  that merges my own and [Daniel Butters'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbutters/) MSc projects together.

My side of this project mostly focussed on the development of the mobile base itself, wheel/leg/robot-level controllers and the overall robot behaviour. The above linked paper covers two main topics - the omnidirectionality of this custom mobile base and the (lack of) deterioration arm end-effector trajectory during base motion.
